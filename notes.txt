Can we use this data to improve our understanding of analytical sampling
have the food comps changed over time for equiv foods? whole wheat vlour in 2010 vs 2020
When comparing, does the mean value for the SR legacy fall between the min and max values of the foundation foods 
which nutrients fall out of range the most and which fall in range more frequently?
Which food groups have had the biggest change?
